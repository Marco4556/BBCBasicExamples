# BBCBasicExamples
A few days ago I discovered BBC Basic and I think it's fantastic. In this repo I will add from time to time some simple programs I wrote to learn this language

Feel free to check them out and make your own versions!


To view the files, however, you need a BBC Basic Editor. I recommend BBC Basic for SDL2 (https://www.bbcbasic.co.uk/bbcsdl/index.html).
